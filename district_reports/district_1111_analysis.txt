3. **Quality Enhancements**: Focus on enhancing quality through menu revamps, service improvements, or introducing unique culinary experiences to drive ratings up.

**Strategic Recommendations**

For existing businesses:

1. **Refine Menu Offerings**: Update menus to incorporate more affordable options and maintain a strong focus on quality to justify higher prices.
2. **Invest in Service**: Enhance customer experience through attentive staff, efficient seating, and personalized interactions.

For new businesses:

1. **Unique Concept**: Develop a distinctive concept that combines cuisine diversity with affordability (e.g., food trucks or casual eateries).
2. **Quality Focus**: Prioritize exceptional quality, service, and presentation to differentiate from competitors.
